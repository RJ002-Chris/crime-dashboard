                Seattle, a city home to a large tech industry, with Microsoft and Amazon headquartered in its
                metropolitan
                area. However, the streets of Seattle may not be safe as one might think. With a crime rate of 66 per
                one
                thousand residents, Seattle has one of the highest crime rates in all of America compared to other
                cities.
                Here in rainy city, one's chance of becoming a victim of either violent or property crime here is one in
                15.
            </p>
            <p>
                The data is displayed as a choropleth map because the original dataset contained the individual points (crime
                reports), including their latitude and longitutde of where they were reported. Since the data
                visualization was not easy to observe as individual points on the map, so I found a
                <a href="https://data-seattlecitygis.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/SeattleCityGIS::neighborhood-map-atlas-neighborhoods/explore?location=47.677875%2C-122.323620%2C14.35">dataset</a>
                 containing neighborhoods in Seattle and spatially joined them before calculating the total number of
                crime reports within each neighborhood. There two main data visualization components of the map are:
                <ul>
                    <li>bar chart</li>
                    <li>dynamic visualization that appears when the user clicks on a neighborhood of Seattle</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
